## General info

I found that all the note taking apps that I tried were either too complicated, too big, or didn't address my needs. So I decided to build my own. I needed a place to keep short-term todos, long-term todos, and random notes. I wanted them to be in a single view, to be displayed separately, and to have separate inputs.

## Further development

1. This project is a work in progress. I do it in my free time.
2. I would like to do more to the UI to make it look more interesting.
3. I think that if I could make it drag-n-drop'able from short-term to long-term and visa versa, that would be useful.
4. A date-picker on the long-term tasks is also something I'm considering, though I haven't decided if that would be necessary or not.
5. User authentication and storage of user tasks/notes is something I'm currently working on. I added store to local storage but I'd like to develop it further.
6. I'm going to write tests for it. Though idealy I would have done that first.
